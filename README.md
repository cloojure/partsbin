# partsbin

You see a tray full of interchangeable parts. You reach in and grab some and start putting things together. Something starts to form. You mostly like what you see but you need to swap out a few things. No problem, it's all super easy. You tinker a bit more and the next thing you know you have a working system.

This is partsbin - a set of reusable components and a philosophy for building simple systems.

The goal of this project is to:

1. Provide some best practices for designing simple, composable systems.
1. Provide a few useful functions for working with [Integrant](https://github.com/weavejester/integrant) or similar libraries. As such, when the namespace alias `ig` is used we are referring to `[integrant.core :as ig]`.
1. Provide reference implementations for some common parts.

As such, it can be used in a few ways:

1. Read it for good advice on how to build composable, data-driven systems (no need to use any of the code here, or just vendor what you will).
1. Use the top-level utility methods found in `partsbin.system`, `partsbin.middleware`, etc. but define your own `ig/init-key` methods.
1. Use the provided implementations of `ig/init-key` as well.

## Definitions

Since we have multiple frameworks out there for reloadable systems (e.g. [Integrant](https://github.com/weavejester/integrant), [Component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component), [Mount](https://github.com/tolitius/mount), we need to clarify the following for this discussion:

* A **system** is the top level set of components to be used. For this project, it is the result of calling `integrant.core/init`.
* A **component** is a sub-element of a system which may have both init-time and runtime dependencies on other components in the system. I may also use 'part' interchangeably with component in this document.


To illustrate, here is a sample system with the various aspects labelled:
``` 
;The pre-initialized system configuration
(def config
  {::jdbc/connection    {:connection-uri "jdbc:h2:mem:mem_only"}
   ::datomic/database   {:db-uri  "datomic:mem://example"
                         :delete? true}
   ::datomic/connection {:database (ig/ref ::datomic/database)
                         :db-uri   "datomic:mem://example"}
   ::web/server         {:host         "0.0.0.0"
                         :port         3000
                         :sql-conn     (ig/ref ::jdbc/connection)
                         :datomic-conn (ig/ref ::datomic/connection)
                         :handler      #'app}})

;The initialized configuration is a system
(def system (ig/init config))

;Component or part refers to the same concept
(def web-component (system ::web/server))
(def web-part (system ::web/server))
```

## Philosophy & Best Practices

The overarching aim of partsbin is to provide a conceptual framework that facilitates functional, data-driven architectures. As such, here are some guiding principles and practices that will help to achieve this goal:

* Develop your API bottom-up with simple functions. Functions should be written with a _logical_ component in the first position and then a small number of arguments after. If more than 1 argument to the function is required beyond the component itself, consider passing a map in as the second argument instead.
* Do NOT write your APIs with partsbin or any other API, framework, or system that will consume it in mind. Write your functions as if you had no knowledge of the system(s) that will use it. This keeps your interfaces simple. This includes not using system keys in your functions.
  * Good: `(myfunction datomic-conn arg)` - Just takes a connection and arguments with no regard to partsbin or the system map.
  * Good: `(myfunction {:keys[datomic-conn]} arg)` - If it makes sense for the component to be a map, ensure that the keys are generic to what is being done in the calling function. `datomic-conn` implies that this is a generic Datomic connection and is not system or config specific.
  * Bad: `(myfunction {:keys[project-x/conn]} arg)` - relies on knowing the configuration/system keys of your system.
* When consuming other APIs from partsbin, consider initializing your components to be in the correct format to be used for those APIs. For example, [Clojure JDBC](http://clojure.github.io/java.jdbc/#clojure.java.jdbc) functions take a map in their first position and many [Monger](http://reference.clojuremongodb.info/) functions take a connection. By initializing your components in this fashion you can use those APIs directly without having to use wrappers or restructure your arguments.
* Try to use one part/component at a time in functions. If you need more than one part for a particular functionality, consider using an api such as core.async or rx so that data flows through your system and uses only one part at a time at each stage. Many parts in a function may be a code smell for bad, non-reconfigurable architecture and one-part-per-function is a sign of a good design. If you do need multiple components in a function, combine them into a single map with generic keys.
  * Good: `(myfunction datomic-conn args)` - Only the datomic connection is used here.
  * Bad: `(myfunction datomic-conn sql-conn args)` - Two different parts are used in two positions.
  * Better: `(myfunction {:keys[datomic-conn sql-conn]} args)` - If multiple system components are needed for a single function, combine them using ig/ref to create a single, logical component with all required component.
  * Terrible: `(myfunction {:keys[project-x/datomic-connection project-x/hornetq]} arg1 arg2)` - You are conflating your system with your function. This is making your code system-specific and non-generic.
* Related to the above, parts should be combined in their initializers. Meaning, if you have some process that takes several parts (e.g. data from a db needs to flow to a queue) then do write functional logic that does the db work and another function that does the queue work then _in the part configuration_ you can put a function that does all the key renaming, function calling, etc.
* Var quote (e.g. #'(foo) vs foo)) lambdas when they are passed in as config params. This will prevent you from having to reload your system when the function changes.
* Ensure that ig/init *always* succeeds. If exceptional or failure behavior occurs (e.g. a DB is unavailable) it is ok to return a failed or broken state rather than just blowing up initialization. This facilitates investigation and recovery. For example, if you have a repl server running you could jack in and inspect the state or try to restart. If, on the other hand, the application has failed due to your exceptions you are in an irrecoverable and non-debuggable state.

## Challenges

* If you detect cycles in your dependency graph you likely want to expose your _system_ in some aspect of your API downstream. For example, you want your system viewable from your web server API code. If this happens, this is your code telling you that you need to revisit your architecture since you are trying to make your system global. Instead, do this:
  * Change your API to use only the required capabilities of your system (e.g. a db or a web server) 
  * Put the required capabilities into a component (e.g. put a db reference in your web component)
  * The handler for that component should now have the required capabilites available to it
  * Remember the above best practices when doing this. Only put what is needed in each part and design APIs to be parstbin/integrant agnostic.
* Systems in the REPL. Sometimes it can seem kludgly to have to reference a system object in the repl. You will often be wrapping your code in a let form that destructures a db connection, for example. See the following example for what I mean as well as what you can do to work in this situation.

Suppose you want to test the following function. Note that it is not system-aware, but what you have is a system.
```
(defn doit [datomic-conn arg]
  (let[db (d/db datomic-conn)]
    (d/q query db arg)))
```

The right way to test this could be one of the following:
```
;Option 1: Doing this repeatedly in the REPL might be tedious.
(let[{conn ::datomic/connection} system]
  (doit conn arg))

:Option 2: Do this once
(def datomic-conn (::datomic/connection system))
;Do this as much as you want.
(doit conn arg)
```
